# YT-subCount
This Python script is based on Urllib. It takes the raw HTML of the Youtube channel's page and searches for the subscriber count using RegEx. It will also store the exact date and time when PewDiePie hits a hundred Million Subscribers.
You can use it to view any channel's subscriber count by just changing the url in the code and changing the number of characters that are returned from the HTML(from source.txt) in RegEx.
